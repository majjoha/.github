# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for considering contributing. I greatly appreciate it!

This document describes a few general guidelines for how to contribute to this
repository.

## Code of Conduct
Please, read the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before continuing if
you haven't already.

## Submitting issues
If you believe you have found a bug, please look through the existing and closed
issues before submitting a new one. If you cannot find any, report the issue
with a clear description of the current behavior, expected behavior, the exact
steps which reproduce the issue, and any other details that might be relevant,
and I would be happy to investigate it.

## Submitting changes
For changes that are large and/or breaking, it might be worth opening an issue
first to discuss it. If you are fixing an issue that has been reported, please
comment on it and let others know that you are working on fixing it. Also,
remember to reference it in your pull request as described
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

To submit changes, follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (A few tips on writing good commit messages can be found
   [here](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)).
4. Push your branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
5. Create a new pull request.

Code changes should always adhere to the existing code style. If you are adding
new code, please also ensure you add accompanying tests (and documentation when
relevant).

When submitting your pull request, please explain the motivation for making the
changes in detail, what it is trying to solve, and how you have tested it.

Lastly, but most importantly, be nice and have fun!
